What is software:
Different typea of softwares:
1.System Software:Device drivers, OS, Servers, utilities etc.,
2.Progamming software:debuggers, compilers,interpreters etc.,
3.Application software:Web Applications, Mobile applications, Desktop applications.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Testing?


An activity of comparing expected value with Actual value.
Expected value: Client requirement
Actual value: After Development, Application developed by a programmar or developer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Software testing
It is a process of executing an application to find out defects in the software.
MAin Objective: Quality to the clients

Quality Product: Based on paramaters
1.Bugs free
2.with in the time framework
3.less cost or with in budget
4.maintainability
5.client requirement

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defect can be used in 3 terminologies:

Error: Before development, if the developer finds any mistakes.Human Mistakes

Bug/Defect: After development , Tester will find the mistakes.(Expected != actual VAlue

Failure: If the Customer faces any problems while using the application under end user environment.


---------------------------------------------------
Project Vs Product

Project: If an application developed for specific customer , it is calls Project ased application.
(service based companies like Infosys, Tcs etc.,)


Product:If an application developed for entire market based on market requirements, it is called product based application.
(Product bases companies like Google, Microsoft etc.,)

MAnual Testing Vs Automation Testing

MAnual Testing usually done by man power

MAnual testing involves human testing and intercating with the software application and identify the bugs/ defects.

Automation testing: It uses computer programs, applications or scripts to write pre-defined testa and run programatically.

Advantages of MAnual testing:
-------------------------------

Cost Effective:
Adaptable
Technology-independent
intuitive

advantages of Automatic testing:

-------------------------------
More Test coverage
Quick and Efficient
Reusable (we use scripts everytime required)
Reliable

DisadvantageS
====================
Manual testing:
-------------
slow & tedious
Human errors
Resource-heavy
Inconsistent
Low test coverage


Automation testing:
----------------
More expensive
Less flexible
add unnecessary complexity
Less intuitive

Differences between Manual testing and Automation testing with-respect-to Testing Aspects:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Accuracy

2.Cost efficiency  ( less --- M) , (more--A)

3.Reliability      (High --M), ( less_A)

4.Test coverages    (Less--M), (more -A)

5.Scalability         (Less -M), (more -A)

6.User experience    ( Effective --M), ( ineffective -A)

7.Test cycle Time   (shorter - M)  ( Effective -- A)

8 Human Resources ( more -M )  ( Less --A)

SDLC:It is the structured process used by software industry to design, develop, test and deploy the quality product /software to the customer.

Main goal of the SDLC is to minimize risk before deciding to deploy the product to the end-users 
and ensures thst the software meets the customers expectations both during and after production.



Benefits:

1. Increased visibilty of the development process for all stakeholders (Project managers, Developers, testers, clients...)involved.
2.More efficinet estimation, planning and scheduling
3.Improved Risk Management and cost estimation
4.A systematic approach to delivering software that meets the customers expectations and improvs satisfaction.


  Phases:
---------------
1.Planning:Where you were gathering dusiness requirements fromthe client or Stakeholders.

2.Requirement analysis : 1st analyze the requiremets  and inform he requirements to the deveopers. Here Business analyst will prepare Brs 
( Business requirement specification documents), SRs ( Software requirement Specifications) , Use case documents, RTM ( Requirement tracebility matrix) documents 

3.Designing :  Here original plan and vision are elaborated into the software design Document(SDD), which includes system design, programming language,
 templates , platform to use and the application security measures.

4.Coding and  Development : Where here development team members divide the software into small modules and
 turn the software requiremnt into code that the makes the prodect.

5.Testing: before getting the software product out the door of the Production envirnmnet, its important to have your quality assurance team 
perform validation testing to make sure it is functioning properly and does what it meants to do.
Types of testings we will perform in this phase:
1.Performnce testing
2.Functional testing
3.Security testing
4.Unit testing
5.Usability testing
6.Acceptance testing


6.Deploying : Here in this phase,the product or software is delivered to the Client.

                                                                                                                                                                
7.Maintainability :It is final stage of the SDLC.
